# Team Profile Generator
 
## Description
We were tasked with creating a command line application that could create a profile for multiple members of a Software engineering team on an HTML page. It would be completed using Node.js, and would contain a quick summary of each person, including their email, id number and either their: University, Office location, or github username.
